# AddressBook
I have Created a front-end of the web application.
and due to some limitation of the internet and hardare issues i caanot complete the backend of the application. 
I have used html css to make a intractive front end User Interface and I have tried to use mysql for backend but due to limitation of resources available i can't able to do it but i have attached the php files along with html file with sql queries.
